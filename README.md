# Spectral methods for reaction-diffusion on axisymmetric surfaces

Requirements:
* [Chebfun](http://www.chebfun.org/) for conveniently computing with smooth functions in MATLAB.
* [This repository](https://github.com/danfortunato/spherical-harmonic-interfaces) for spherical harmonic transforms (only required for the sphere).
